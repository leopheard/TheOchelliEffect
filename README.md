<a href="kodi.tv">KODI<a> / XBMC / Firestick audio addon for the <a href="http://ochelli.com/">Ochelli Effect</a> podcast.<br>

The <a href="http://ochelli.com/">Ochelli Effect</a> podcast launched in late 2013 as an outlet for independent critical analysis of historical controversies, current geo-politics, social issues, media, breaking news and literature from Chuck’s perspective. After appearing as a guest and caller on multiple live internet broadcasts for many previous years and receiving encouragement from other talk show hosts, The Ochelli Effect debuted as a regularly scheduled, unscripted interview program. The overall objective via the “Revelation of Conversation” concept is to incite education regarding the assassinations of the 60’s, the alleged “War on Terror”, Esoteric Psychology, the fictional “Drug Wars”, Spirituality, the Incremental erosion of freedoms in post 9/11 America and Main Stream Media Manipulation promoting mass ignorance.<br>

Edward Griffin, Scott Enyart, Clyde Lewis, Joan Mellen, Abraham Bolden, Roger Stone, John Barbour, H.P.
